# CSCI 1105 CH1 Notes

### Hardware Stuff
* CPU: consists of Arithmetic/Logic Unit(ALU) & Logical operations.
* 0 or 1 = bit
* 8 bits = 1 byte

### Language Concepts
* interpeter: reads one statement from code, translates it to machine code and executes it right away
* compiler: translate ebtire sourcecode to machine code, then executes it
* multiprogramming: llows multiple programs to run simul on same cpu
* multithreading: allows a single program to executre mulitple task simul
* multiprocessing: uses two or more proccessors together to perform subtasks concurrently and combine solution. (aka pararrel processing)

### Java Specifics
* API = Application Program Interface, aka library
* All java programs must have atleast 1 class, (1st letter uppercase for convention)
* Comments are same as C
* compile as: $ javac ClassName.java
* run as: $ java ClassName
* Source file(.java) must have the same exact name as the public class name
