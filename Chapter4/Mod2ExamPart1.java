// Type 3 gives you far more control over the logic of the program.Â  Type 1 and 2 only allow for the base amount to be decided two ways, where as type 3 allows for as many as you want(all though a switch statement may be better, would also avoid nested if else statement to improve both speed and readability). Type 3 can result in many different base amounts, where as the other two are far more limited.
